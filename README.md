# Prehevil Treaty ETA website

> **Note:** This repository pertains to fictional countries on the [bits & Bytes Minecraft server](https://bnbmc.net).

This is the website for applying for electronic travel authorizations for the Prehevil Treaty free-travel zone.

It is split into a frontend and a backend.

## Development

Node.js v22 or later must be installed to build and run the project.

The project is written in TypeScript. The backend uses Node.js, and the frontend uses Vue and Nuxt.

First, install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To run the backend or frontend in development mode with automatic reload:
```
npm run backend:dev
npm run frontend:dev
```

To build the frontend:
```
npm run frontend:build
```

The output will be in `frontend/dist`.

To preview the frontend after building:
```
npm run frontend:preview
```
