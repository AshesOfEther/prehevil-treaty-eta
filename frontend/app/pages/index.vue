		<h1>Prehevil Treaty</h1>
		<h2>About electronic travel authorizations</h2>
		<p>Under the Prehevil Treaty, the following countries compose a free-travel zone, with a shared visa and electronic travel authorization (ETA) policy:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Bohemia</li>
			<li>Fegal</li>
			<li>Solstice</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Once issued, an ETA is valid for 7 days, and allows you to enter and leave the aforementioned countries as many times as you'd like. It is valid for most purposes, with the exception of work and long-term stays.</p>

		<p>The ETA system enhances the security of the zone's borders, by enabling the countries to perform checks before arrival.</p>

		<p>Prehevil Treaty ETAs are not usable for entry into TAY. <a href="https://tay.aircs.racing/eta">You can apply for a TAY ETA here</a>.</p>

		<h2>Apply for an ETA</h2>

		<p>Applying for an ETA is free, and only takes a couple minutes. You will usually receive a response instantly.</p>

		<h2>Who needs an ETA?</h2>

		<p>Most people are eligible for an ETA.</p>

		<p>Citizens of countries within the free-travel zone, as well as TAY, do not require an ETA under the Prehevil Treaty, and can enter the free-travel zone at will.</p>
